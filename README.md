2018 info - graph2font picture with added max. 1024k vertical text 'scroller'

This little programme is part of the new years disc 2018 for ATARI 8bit series and
shows how to add some own code to the code the graph2font tool creates.

There is a short loading screen added, a timer how long the picture is shown and
some code to show the info text at the screen and go up and down via consol keys
or joystick moves up and down.

No big magic, no real vertical scrolling, but maybe useful for someone who wants to
understand how to code in asm for the ATARI 8bit computers.

The asm source is for MADS (http://mads.atari8.info).

Feel free to use everything :)
